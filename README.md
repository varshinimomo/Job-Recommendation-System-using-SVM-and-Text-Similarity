# Job-Recommendation-System-using-SVM-and-Text-Similarity
A job recommendation system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify user profiles into job categories and TF-IDF with cosine similarity to match and rank job postings. It predicts the job type and recommends the top N relevant jobs based on profile similarity.

Explanation:
TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity is great for finding semantically similar jobs based on the user's profile.

SVM classification provides a probable category match (e.g., IT) that aligns with what similar job descriptions belong to.
